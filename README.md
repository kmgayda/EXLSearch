This is a demo application written in C#/ASP.NET Core.  It consists of a data access layer using Entity Core as the ORM. 
It uses an in-memory database as it is only for demonstation purposes.  This is done for ease of setup.
It has an NUnit test app, a Web API Core app to deliver web services and an ASP.NET/MVC Core application for the UI.  
It uses bootstrap.js for formatting the UI

Setup
There is very little setup necessary. Just download the source code and set two startup projects, the UI project and the API project.
